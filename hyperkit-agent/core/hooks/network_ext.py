Future Network Extension Interface (DOCUMENTATION ONLY)
========================================================

⚠️  CRITICAL: This file is DOCUMENTATION ONLY - NO IMPLEMENTATION.

This module documents the interface contract for future multi-network support.
Current system is HYPERION-ONLY - this is a reference for future development.

DO NOT import or use this module in production code.
DO NOT implement these interfaces until Hyperion deployment is flawless.

Purpose:
--------
This file serves as a blueprint for future network extension capabilities.
It defines the interface contract that any new network integration must follow,
ensuring consistency and maintainability when multi-network support is added.

Architecture Principles:
----------------------  
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each network module handles ONE network only
2. **Dependency Injection**: Networks are injected, not hardcoded
3. **Interface Segregation**: Clear, minimal interfaces per network
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Extension via new modules, not modification
5. **Fail Hard**: Unsupported networks raise errors immediately

Future Network Interface Contract:
-----------------------------------

class NetworkInterface(Protocol):
    \"\"\"
    Protocol/Interface for network implementations.
    
    All future network modules MUST implement this interface.
    \"\"\"
    
    @property
    def chain_id(self) -> int:
        \"\"\"Return chain ID for this network.\"\"\"
        ...
    
    @property
    def rpc_url(self) -> str:
        \"\"\"Return RPC endpoint URL.\"\"\"
        ...
    
    @property
    def explorer_url(self) -> str:
        \"\"\"Return block explorer URL.\"\"\"
        ...
    
    def deploy_contract(
        self,
        contract_code: str,
        constructor_args: Optional[List[Any]] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        \"\"\"
        Deploy contract to this network.
        
        Returns:
            Deployment result with tx_hash, contract_address, etc.
        \"\"\"
        ...
    
    def verify_contract(
        self,
        contract_address: str,
        source_code: str
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        \"\"\"
        Verify contract on this network's explorer.
        
        Returns:
            Verification result with status and explorer_url.
        \"\"\"
        ...
    
    def get_transaction_status(self, tx_hash: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        \"\"\"Get transaction status from this network.\"\"\"
        ...


Future Network Registration:
-----------------------------

class NetworkRegistry:
    \"\"\"
    Central registry for network implementations.
    
    Future networks register here at startup.
    \"\"\"
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._networks: Dict[str, NetworkInterface] = {}
        self._default_network = "hyperion"
    
    def register(self, name: str, network: NetworkInterface):
        \"\"\"Register a network implementation.\"\"\"
        self._networks[name] = network
    
    def get(self, name: str) -> NetworkInterface:
        \"\"\"Get network by name. Raises if not found.\"\"\"
        if name not in self._networks:
            raise ValueError(f"Network '{name}' not registered")
        return self._networks[name]


Future Network Module Structure:
--------------------------------

Each future network (e.g., LazAI, Metis) would have its own module:

```
services/networks/
    ├── hyperion.py          # Existing (current implementation)
    ├── lazai.py             # Future: LazAI network only (NOT AI agent)
    └── metis.py             # Future: Metis network only
```

Each module:
1. Implements NetworkInterface
2. Handles network-specific logic (RPC calls, explorer integration)
3. Is completely independent (no cross-network dependencies)
4. Registers itself with NetworkRegistry on import


Extension Hooks (No Code Yet):
------------------------------

When ready to add multi-network support:

1. **Create Network Modules**: Implement NetworkInterface in new modules
2. **Register Networks**: Add registration calls in config/system startup
3. **Update CLI**: Add --network flag (currently hidden/deprecated)
4. **Update Config**: Add network configs (currently removed for Hyperion-only)
5. **Update Tests**: Add network-specific test suites
6. **Document Migration**: Update ROADMAP.md with implementation checklist


Critical Notes:
---------------

- DO NOT implement any of the above until Hyperion is flawless
- DO NOT create stub implementations - wait for real need
- DO NOT modify existing Hyperion code to support other networks
- Current system MUST remain Hyperion-only until explicitly extended
- Any future network must be added as NEW module, not modification of existing


Example Future Implementation (NOT TO IMPLEMENT YET):
------------------------------------------------------

```python
# services/networks/lazai.py (DO NOT CREATE YET)
# This is an example of how it WOULD work in the future

from typing import Protocol, Dict, Any, Optional, List
from .network_interface import NetworkInterface

class LazAINetwork(NetworkInterface):
    \"\"\"LazAI network implementation (network-only, NOT AI agent).\"\"\"
    
    @property
    def chain_id(self) -> int:
        return 9001
    
    @property
    def rpc_url(self) -> str:
        return "https://rpc.lazai.network/testnet"
    
    @property
    def explorer_url(self) -> str:
        return "https://testnet-explorer.lazai.network"
    
    def deploy_contract(self, contract_code: str, constructor_args=None):
        # Network-specific deployment logic
        pass
    
    def verify_contract(self, contract_address: str, source_code: str):
        # Network-specific verification logic
        pass
    
    def get_transaction_status(self, tx_hash: str):
        # Network-specific status check
        pass
```

DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE ABOVE - This is reference documentation only.


Migration Checklist (For Future):
---------------------------------

When ready to add multi-network support:

- [ ] Design network interface protocol (see above)
- [ ] Create NetworkRegistry singleton
- [ ] Implement NetworkInterface for new networks
- [ ] Add network registration on startup
- [ ] Update CLI to expose --network flag
- [ ] Update config validation to accept new networks
- [ ] Update all deployment/verification services
- [ ] Add network-specific tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove "HYPERION-ONLY" restrictions


Current State (Hyperion-Only):
------------------------------

- ✅ Hyperion network fully implemented and tested
- ✅ All CLI commands hardcoded to Hyperion
- ✅ Config validation rejects non-Hyperion networks
- ✅ System fails hard on unsupported network requests
- ✅ Documentation clearly states Hyperion-only mode
- ✅ Future plans documented here (no code stubs)

- Config validation: `core/config/config_validator.py`
- CLI commands: `cli/commands/` (all hardcoded to Hyperion)
