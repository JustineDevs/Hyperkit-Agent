5. **One Submission Per Issue**: No duplicates

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Keys and Secrets

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# ❌ WRONG: Never hardcode in files
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-..."  # Don't do this!
```

#### Private Keys

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use .env file (in .gitignore)
DEFAULT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# ❌ WRONG: Never commit private keys
git add .env  # Don't do this!
```

#### Secure Configuration

```yaml
# config.yaml - Use placeholders
ai_providers:
  openai:
    api_key: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE'  # ✅ Placeholder
    model: 'gpt-4'
```

### For Developers

#### Code Security

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Input validation
def deploy_contract(address: str):
    if not Web3.is_address(address):
        raise ValueError("Invalid address")
    # ... rest of code

# ❌ WRONG: No validation
def deploy_contract(address):
    # Direct use without validation
```

#### Dependency Security

```bash
# Run security checks
pip install safety bandit
safety check
bandit -r hyperkit-agent/

# Update dependencies regularly
pip install --upgrade pip
pip list --outdated
```

#### Smart Contract Security

```solidity
// ✅ CORRECT: Use ReentrancyGuard
contract SecureToken is ReentrancyGuard {
    function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
        // Safe from reentrancy
    }
}

// ❌ WRONG: No protection
contract UnsafeToken {
    function withdraw() external {
        // Vulnerable to reentrancy
    }
}
```
