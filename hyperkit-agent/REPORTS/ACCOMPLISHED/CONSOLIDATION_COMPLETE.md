## Next Steps

### 1. Review Consolidated Files ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: Review each consolidated file to ensure:
- All content merged correctly
- Table of contents accurate
- No formatting issues
- Content is properly organized

### 2. Fix Cross-References 🔗

Search for and update any links referencing old file names:

```bash
# Find references to old files
grep -r "IPFS_RAG_BEST_PRACTICES\|ACCOMPLISHED/.*\.md" hyperkit-agent/
grep -r "AUDIT_BADGE_REPORT\|SECURITY_ASSESSMENT" hyperkit-agent/
```

Update to reference consolidated files:
- `IPFS_RAG/IPFS_RAG_BEST_PRACTICES.md` → `IPFS_RAG/IPFS.md#best-practices`
- `ACCOMPLISHED/ALL_TODOS_COMPLETE_2025-10-27.md` → `ACCOMPLISHED/ACCOMPLISHED.md#all-todos-complete`
- etc.

### 3. Delete Obsolete Files 🗑️

After reviewing consolidated files, run deletion script:

```bash
cd hyperkit-agent/REPORTS
# Edit delete_obsolete_files.py to set dry_run = False
python delete_obsolete_files.py
```

**Files to Delete**: 58 individual markdown files (listed in script output)

## CTO Brutal Advice (Applied)

> "Stop 'exploding' reports into a million nearly empty shards. It's bloat for bloat's sake. This merge is how grown-up, legible projects do documentation—commit to it, and your repo will radiate signal, not noise."

**Status**: ✅ **COMMITTED - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
