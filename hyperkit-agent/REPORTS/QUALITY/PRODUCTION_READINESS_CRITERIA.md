<!-- /VERSION_PLACEHOLDER -->

## Overview

This document defines explicit criteria for production readiness of the HyperKit Agent platform. All criteria must be met before any production deployment.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Documentation & Code Sync ✅
- [x] All documentation uses `hyperagent` CLI commands only
- [x] No references to deprecated `main.py` or python scripts
- [x] Version numbers synchronized across all files
- [x] Implementation status clearly documented

### 2. Test Coverage & Quality ⚠️
- [x] Test suite runs without collection errors (19/27 tests passing)
- [ ] All CLI commands have passing E2E tests
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for core functionality
- [ ] No critical test failures

### 3. CLI Command Validation ⚠️
- [x] CLI validation script created and functional
- [x] All commands have help working
- [ ] All commands execute successfully without errors
- [ ] Command execution validation completed

### 4. Integration Status ✅
- [x] Mock integrations audited and documented
- [x] LAZAI/ALITH SDK status clearly marked as NOT IMPLEMENTED
- [x] No false claims about unavailable features

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Critical (Must Pass)
- [ ] **All CLI commands execute successfully**
  - `hyperagent generate` - Contract generation
  - `hyperagent deploy` - Multi-chain deployment
  - `hyperagent audit` - Security auditing
  - `hyperagent workflow run` - End-to-end workflows
  - `hyperagent status` - System status
  - `hyperagent monitor` - Health monitoring

- [ ] **Test suite passes completely**
  - Unit tests: 27/27 passing
  - Integration tests: All passing
  - E2E tests: All passing

- [ ] **No deprecated references**
  - No `main.py` references in docs
  - No python script references
  - All workflows use CLI commands

### High Priority (Should Pass)
- [ ] **RAG Integration fully functional**
  - IPFS template fetching works
  - Offline fallbacks work
  - Template versioning works

- [ ] **Multi-network deployment validated**
  - Hyperion network tested
  - Metis network tested
  - Andromeda network tested

- [ ] **Security audit pipeline functional**
  - Contract auditing works
  - Batch auditing works
  - Report generation works

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] **Advanced monitoring**
  - Health checks functional
  - Performance monitoring
  - Error tracking

- [ ] **Documentation completeness**
  - All guides executable
  - No stub processes
  - Clear implementation status

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ Completed
1. **Documentation Drift Cleanup** - All docs updated to use CLI commands
2. **Version Automation** - Automated version sync across all files
3. **Test Suite Fix** - Fixed collection errors, 19/27 tests passing
4. **CLI Command Validation** - Validation script created and functional
5. **Integration SDK Audit** - Mock integrations documented as NOT IMPLEMENTED
6. **Implementation Status Tracking** - Clear status dashboard created

### ⚠️ In Progress
1. **CLI Command Execution** - Help works, basic execution needs fixes
2. **Test Coverage** - Need to get all tests passing
3. **Production Readiness Criteria** - This document

### ❌ Not Started
1. **Deadweight Removal** - Archive legacy files
2. **Audit Badge System** - Add implementation badges
3. **Drift Prevention Policy** - PR requirements
4. **E2E Testing** - Comprehensive test suite

## Production Deployment Gates

### Gate 1: Core Functionality ✅
- [x] CLI commands discoverable and help working
- [x] Documentation synchronized with code
- [x] Version management automated

### Gate 2: Test Quality ⚠️
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage adequate
- [ ] No critical failures

### Gate 3: Command Execution ❌
- [ ] All CLI commands execute successfully
- [ ] Error handling robust
- [ ] User experience smooth

### Gate 4: Production Validation ❌
- [ ] Multi-network deployment tested
- [ ] Security audit pipeline validated
- [ ] RAG integration fully functional

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **CLI Command Failures** - Commands fail on basic execution
2. **Test Failures** - 8/27 tests failing
3. **Mock Integrations** - False claims about AI capabilities

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Fix CLI Commands** - Debug and fix execution issues
2. **Complete Test Suite** - Fix failing tests
3. **Clear Documentation** - Mark mock features as NOT IMPLEMENTED

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- CLI command success rate: 100%
- Test pass rate: 100%
- Documentation accuracy: 100%

### Operational Metrics
- Deployment success rate: >95%
- User onboarding success: >90%
- Support ticket reduction: >50%

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
   - Fix CLI command execution issues
   - Complete test suite fixes
   - Validate RAG integration

2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Multi-network deployment testing
   - Security audit pipeline validation
   - Production deployment preparation

3. **Medium Term (Next Month)**
   - Advanced monitoring implementation
   - Performance optimization
   - User experience improvements
