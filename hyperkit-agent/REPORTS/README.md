hyperagent workflow "Create a simple ERC20 token"

# With automation flag
hyperagent workflow "Create a complex DeFi protocol" --allow-insecure
```

### Smart Contract Generation
```bash
# Generate with smart naming
hyperagent generate "Create a UniswapV2-style DEX"
# Output: artifacts/generate/defi/DEX.sol

hyperagent generate "Create a gaming NFT marketplace"
# Output: artifacts/generate/nft/NFTMarketplace.sol
```

### Command Organization
```bash
# Each command saves to its own directory
hyperagent workflow "Create token"    # â†’ artifacts/workflows/
hyperagent generate "Create DEX"      # â†’ artifacts/generate/
hyperagent audit "contract.sol"      # â†’ artifacts/audit/
hyperagent deploy "contract.sol"     # â†’ artifacts/deploy/
```
