## 🎯 Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Active exploit, funds at risk, data breach | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Private key leaked, active reentrancy exploit, RCE vulnerability |
| **P1 - High** | Security vulnerability, no active exploit | < 24 hours | Unpatched CVE in dependencies, insecure contract function |
| **P2 - Medium** | Functionality broken, user impact | < 48 hours | Deployment failures, broken workflows |

## 🔥 Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-15 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Confirm the incident
- Verify the report is legitimate
- Classify severity (P0-P3)
- Activate emergency response team

# 2. Initial assessment
- Document what is affected
- Estimate blast radius
- Check if exploit is active
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Incident confirmed and documented
- [ ] Severity classified
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Initial assessment complete

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

```bash
# For P0 Critical incidents:

# 1. PAUSE affected systems
# If contracts are deployed and vulnerable:
# - Contact admin wallet holders
# - Execute pause function if available
# - Warn users via all channels

# 2. ISOLATE the vulnerability
# - Disable affected features
- Tag affected commits: git tag security-incident-YYYYMMDD
# - Document exploit vector

# 3. PROTECT user funds
# - If applicable, initiate emergency withdrawal
# - Coordinate with block explorers for transparency
```

**P0 Critical Incident Commands**:

```bash
# Pause deployment pipeline
touch .deployment-paused

# Disable affected features (update config)
hyperagent config set security.emergency_mode true

# Alert users
echo "🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT DETECTED - Systems paused" > ALERT.txt
git add ALERT.txt && git commit -m "EMERGENCY: Security incident containment" && git push
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Affected systems paused
- [ ] Vulnerability isolated
- [ ] Users warned
- [ ] Funds protected (if applicable)
- [ ] Incident documented

### Phase 3: Investigation (1-4 hours)

```bash
# 1. Root cause analysis
- Review commit history: git log --all --oneline --graph
- Check affected code: git blame <file>
- Identify introduction point
- Document exploit timeline

# 2. Scope assessment
- List all affected versions
- Identify deployed contracts at risk
- Check for similar vulnerabilities

# 3. Develop fix
- Create hotfix branch: git checkout -b hotfix/CVE-YYYYMMDD-NNN
- Implement fix
- Write regression tests
```

**Commands**:

```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Security-specific tests
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Build and test contracts
forge build && forge test -vvv
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Scope fully understood
- [ ] Fix developed and tested
- [ ] Regression tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Phase 4: Patch Deployment (4-8 hours)

```bash
# 1. Internal validation
- Run all tests: pytest tests/ -v
- Security scan: bandit -r . -ll
- Peer review by 2+ team members

# 2. Deploy patch
# Quick patch process (bypasses normal CI for P0):
git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY PATCH: [CVE-ID] - [Brief description]"
git tag security-patch-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
git push origin hotfix/security-patch-* --tags

# 3. Update production
# Deploy to testnet first (if time permits)
hyperagent deploy --contract FixedContract.sol --network hyperion

# 4. Verify deployment
hyperagent verify contract <address> --network hyperion
```

**Fast-Track Deployment Checklist**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security scans clean
- [ ] 2+ peer reviews complete
- [ ] Patch committed and tagged
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful (if applicable)
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Verification complete

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Team notified (< 15 min)
- [ ] Stakeholders updated (< 1 hour)
- [ ] Public notice issued (if warranted)
- [ ] Bug bounty researcher credited (if applicable)
- [ ] Post-mortem scheduled

### Phase 6: Monitoring (24-72 hours)

```bash
# 1. Watch for issues
# Monitor system health
hyperagent monitor system

# Check for exploit attempts
# Review logs: tail -f logs/hyperagent.log

# Monitor blockchain activity
# Check deployed contracts for suspicious transactions

# 2. Validate fix effectiveness
# Run extended test suite
pytest tests/ -v --extended

# 3. Track user reports
# Monitor GitHub issues, Discord, support channels
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] 24-hour monitoring active
- [ ] No new exploit attempts detected
- [ ] Fix validated in production
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Metrics tracking normal

## 🚀 Emergency Patch Deployment

### Fast-Track Deployment Process

**Use this ONLY for P0 Critical incidents where normal CI/CD is too slow.**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency_patch.sh - Fast-track security patch deployment

set -e

echo "🚨 EMERGENCY PATCH DEPLOYMENT"
echo "============================"
echo ""

# 1. Verify you're on hotfix branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ ! $BRANCH =~ ^hotfix/security-patch ]]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Must be on a hotfix/security-patch-* branch"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Run critical tests only (fast validation)
echo "🧪 Running critical tests..."
pytest tests/test_basic.py tests/test_deployment_e2e.py -v --tb=short

# 3. Security scan
echo "🔒 Running security scan..."
bandit -r . -ll || echo "⚠️ Security warnings detected - review before continuing"

# 4. Build contracts
echo "🔨 Building contracts..."
forge build

# 5. Create patch commit
echo "📝 Creating patch commit..."
read -p "Enter CVE or incident ID: " CVE_ID
read -p "Enter brief description: " DESCRIPTION

git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY PATCH: ${CVE_ID} - ${DESCRIPTION}

This is an emergency patch for a critical security incident.
Normal CI/CD bypassed for rapid deployment.

See SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG.md for details."

# 6. Tag the patch
TAG="security-patch-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
git tag -a "$TAG" -m "Emergency security patch: ${CVE_ID}"

echo "✅ Patch prepared: $TAG"
echo ""
echo "Next steps:"
echo "  1. Push: git push origin $BRANCH --tags"
echo "  2. Deploy: hyperagent deploy --contract [CONTRACT] --network hyperion"
echo "  3. Verify: hyperagent verify contract [ADDRESS] --network hyperion"
echo "  4. Monitor: hyperagent monitor system"
echo "  5. Merge to main after 24hr monitoring period"
echo ""
echo "🚨 Document this incident in SECURITY_AUDIT_LOG.md"
```
