## 🔴 Critical Issues

### SA-20250125-001: Constructor Argument Mismatch in Deployment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | SA-20250125-001 |
| **Date Reported** | 2025-01-25 |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Category** | Deployment Failure |
| **Status** | Fixed |
| **Affected Versions** | v4.1.7 and earlier |
| **Fixed Version** | v4.1.11 |
| **Reporter** | Internal Testing |
| **Description** | Foundry deployer was generating incorrect constructor arguments, causing deployment failures with "Type error: Incorrect argument count" errors. |
| **Impact** | Users could not deploy contracts successfully, leading to workflow failures and user frustration. |
| **Mitigation** | Updated `foundry_deployer.py` to use ABI-based constructor argument generation and added comprehensive validation. |
| **Related** | Commit: a30d133, Tests: test_deployment_e2e.py |

## 🟡 High Priority Issues

### SA-20251026-002: Exposed API Keys in config.yaml

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | SA-20251026-002 |
| **Date Reported** | 2025-10-26 |
| **Severity** | Critical |
| **Category** | Secrets Exposure |
| **Status** | Fixed |
| **Affected Versions** | v4.1.7 (specific commits) |
| **Fixed Version** | v4.1.8 |
| **Reporter** | GitHub Push Protection |
| **Description** | Actual API keys were committed to config.yaml and pushed to GitHub, triggering GitHub Push Protection. |
| **Impact** | Exposed API keys could be used by unauthorized parties, leading to service abuse and cost overruns. |
| **Mitigation** | Replaced all API keys with placeholders, created env.example, rewrote git history to remove secrets, updated CONTRIBUTING.md with secrets management guidelines. |
| **Related** | Commit: f3170a7, PR: #[pending] |

## 🟢 Medium Priority Issues

### SA-20251026-003: Dependency Version Conflicts (web3/eth-typing)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | SA-20251026-003 |
| **Date Reported** | 2025-10-26 |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Build/Installation Failure |
| **Status** | Fixed |
| **Affected Versions** | v4.1.7 |
| **Fixed Version** | v4.1.8 |
| **Reporter** | GitHub Actions CI |
| **Description** | Incompatible dependency constraints between web3>=7.6.0 and eth-typing>=3.0.0,<4.0 caused installation failures in CI. |
| **Impact** | CI builds failed, preventing automated testing and deployment validation. |
| **Mitigation** | Updated eth-typing constraint to >=5.0.0,<6.0 in pyproject.toml and requirements.txt. |
| **Related** | Commit: [version bump], CI runs: 18813729226 |

## 🔵 Low Priority Issues

### SA-20251026-004: Fake Success Messages in Stub Commands

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | SA-20251026-004 |
| **Date Reported** | 2025-10-26 |
| **Severity** | Low |
| **Category** | User Experience / Misleading Output |
| **Status** | Fixed |
| **Affected Versions** | v4.1.7 and earlier |
| **Fixed Version** | v4.1.11 |
| **Reporter** | User Feedback |
| **Description** | Several CLI commands (verify, monitor, config) printed "Success" messages despite being TODO stubs with no actual functionality. |
| **Impact** | Users received misleading feedback, leading to confusion about system capabilities and false confidence in deployments. |
| **Mitigation** | Implemented all TODO stubs with real functionality or honest "NOT IMPLEMENTED" messages. Added `limitations` command to document known gaps. |
| **Related** | Multiple commits in production readiness push |
