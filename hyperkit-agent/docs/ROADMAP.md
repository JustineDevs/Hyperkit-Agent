# HyperAgent Development Roadmap

**Version**: 1.5.3  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Hyperion-Only Mode Active

---

## üéØ Current Status: Hyperion-Only Mode

**CRITICAL**: HyperAgent is currently in **HYPERION-ONLY MODE**. All deployments, testing, and development focus exclusively on the Hyperion testnet (Chain ID: 133717).

- ‚úÖ **Hyperion Testnet**: Fully supported and production-ready
- ‚ùå **LazAI Network**: Not supported (network-only, future support planned)
- ‚ùå **Metis Mainnet**: Not supported (future support planned)

### Why Hyperion-Only?

To ensure production-grade reliability, we've focused exclusively on Hyperion:
- Simplified architecture reduces complexity and bugs
- Single-network validation ensures deployment reliability
- Hard failure modes prevent silent misconfigurations
- Clear error messages guide users to correct setup

## üìÖ Future Network Support

### Phase 1: Hyperion Stabilization (Current)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Active  
**Timeline**: Q4 2025

- [x] Complete Hyperion-only refactor
- [x] Remove all multi-network complexity
- [x] Implement hard-fail validation
- [x] Create extension interface documentation
- [ ] Achieve 100% deployment success rate on Hyperion
- [ ] Complete E2E test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 2: Network Extension Architecture (Planned)
**Status**: üöß Planned  
**Timeline**: Q1 2026

**Prerequisites:**
- Hyperion deployment success rate >99%
- Complete test coverage
- Stable Alith SDK integration
- Production-ready IPFS Pinata RAG

**Architecture Hooks:**
- Interface contracts documented in `core/hooks/network_ext.py`
- Network registry pattern designed (not implemented)
- Migration checklist prepared

**New Networks (No Code Yet):**
1. **LazAI Network** (Chain ID: 9001)
   - Network-only (blockchain RPC endpoint)
   - NOT an AI agent (use Alith SDK for AI)
   - Testnet support first, then mainnet

2. **Metis Mainnet** (Chain ID: 1088)
   - Full mainnet support
   - Deploy, Verify, Monitor features
   - Explorer integration

**Implementation Requirements:**
- [ ] Design NetworkInterface protocol (see `core/hooks/network_ext.py`)
- [ ] Create NetworkRegistry singleton
- [ ] Implement NetworkInterface for each new network
- [ ] Add network registration on startup
- [ ] Update CLI to expose --network flag (currently hidden)
- [ ] Update config validation to accept new networks
- [ ] Update all deployment/verification services
- [ ] Add network-specific test suites
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove "HYPERION-ONLY" restrictions

## üîÆ Feature Roadmap

### AI Agent Development
- [x] Alith SDK integration (ONLY AI agent)
- [x] Remove all fallback LLM logic
- [ ] Alith SDK advanced features
- [ ] On-chain inference optimization

### RAG System
- [x] IPFS Pinata RAG (exclusive backend)
- [x] Remove Obsidian/MCP RAG
- [ ] Enhanced template versioning
- [ ] Template validation automation

### Security & Auditing
- [x] Multi-source audit consensus
- [x] Hard fail on critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Enhanced ML risk scoring
- [ ] Real-time threat monitoring

### Deployment & Verification
- [x] Foundry integration
- [x] Hyperion explorer verification
- [ ] Multi-network explorer support (future)
- [ ] Automated verification retries

### Testing & Quality
- [x] E2E test framework
- [x] Hyperion-only test suite
- [ ] 100% code coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## üö´ Deprecated/Removed Features

The following features have been **permanently removed** in v1.5.0:

1. **Docker/MCP Support**
   - Dockerfile.mcp, Dockerfile.worker, docker-compose.yml deleted
   - MCP server deprecated
   - Native Python operation only

2. **Multi-Network Deployment**
   - LazAI and Metis network configs removed
   - All CLI commands hardcoded to Hyperion
   - Config validation rejects non-Hyperion networks

3. **Fallback AI Agents**
   - All fallback LLM logic removed from agent
   - Alith SDK is ONLY AI agent (hard fails if unavailable)
   - No silent fallback to other providers

4. **Legacy RAG Systems**
   - Obsidian RAG completely removed
   - MCP/Obsidian integrations deprecated
   - IPFS Pinata is exclusive RAG backend

---

## üìù Contributing Guidelines

### Current Focus (Hyperion-Only)
- All contributions must target Hyperion testnet
- No multi-network logic in new features
- Hard fail patterns required (no silent fallbacks)
- Comprehensive tests required

### Future Network Contributions
When multi-network support is re-enabled:
- Follow interface contracts in `core/hooks/network_ext.py`
- One module per network (no cross-network dependencies)
- Complete test coverage for new network
- Update documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **No Code Stubs**: Future network support is DOCUMENTATION ONLY. No code exists yet.
2. **Interface First**: Network extension architecture must follow documented interfaces.
3. **Hyperion First**: Multi-network support will ONLY be added after Hyperion is flawless.
4. **Hard Failures**: System must always fail clearly, never silently fallback.
