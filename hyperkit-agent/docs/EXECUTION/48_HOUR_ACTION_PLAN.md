## üîß **CRITICAL FIXES TO IMPLEMENT NOW**

### **Fix #1: Character Encoding Error**

**Problem**: `'charmap' codec can't encode characters`

**Location**: `services/audit/auditor.py`

**Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".sol", delete=False) as f:
    f.write(contract_code)

# AFTER  
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".sol", delete=False, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(contract_code)
```

### **Fix #2: Graceful LazAI Fallback**

**Problem**: System errors when LazAI SDK not available

**Location**: `services/core/lazai_integration.py`

**Fix**: Already has try/except, but ensure it doesn't block workflow

### **Fix #3: Global Command Entry Point**

**Problem**: Entry point fixed in `pyproject.toml` but not reinstalled

**Fix**:
```bash
cd hyperkit-agent
pip uninstall hyperkit-agent -y
pip install -e .
hyperagent --help  # Test it works
```

---

## üìã **MINIMUM VIABLE DEMO SCOPE**

### **What MUST Work**

1. ‚úÖ **Generate Command**
   ```bash
   hyperagent generate contract --type ERC20 --name DemoToken --network hyperion
   ```
   - Creates valid Solidity file
   - Saves to artifacts/
   - Returns success message

2. ‚úÖ **Audit Command**
   ```bash
   hyperagent audit contract --contract artifacts/DemoToken.sol
   ```
   - Runs Slither analysis
   - Shows severity level
   - Returns audit results

3. ‚úÖ **Deploy Command**
   ```bash
   hyperagent deploy contract --contract artifacts/DemoToken.sol --network hyperion
   ```
   - Deploys to Hyperion
   - Returns contract address
   - Returns transaction hash

4. ‚úÖ **Complete Workflow**
   ```bash
   hyperagent workflow run "Create ERC20 token named DemoToken" --network hyperion
   ```
   - Runs all 3 stages
   - Shows progress
   - Returns deployed address

### **What Can Wait**

- ‚ùå LazAI integration (no API key)
- ‚ùå All network support (focus on Hyperion)
- ‚ùå Verification (nice to have)
- ‚ùå All CLI commands (focus on core)
- ‚ùå Perfect test coverage
- ‚ùå Complete documentation

## üé¨ **DEMO SCRIPT (2 minutes)**

### **Scene 1: Introduction (15 seconds)**
```
"This is HyperAgent - an AI-powered smart contract development platform.
Let me show you a complete workflow from prompt to deployed contract."
```

### **Scene 2: Generate Contract (30 seconds)**
```bash
hyperagent generate contract --type ERC20 --name DemoToken
# Show: Contract generated successfully
# Show: File created at artifacts/DemoToken.sol
```

### **Scene 3: Audit Contract (30 seconds)**
```bash
hyperagent audit contract --contract artifacts/DemoToken.sol
# Show: Security analysis complete
# Show: Severity: LOW
# Show: No critical issues found
```

### **Scene 4: Deploy Contract (45 seconds)**
```bash
hyperagent deploy contract --contract artifacts/DemoToken.sol --network hyperion
# Show: Deployment in progress...
# Show: Contract deployed successfully
# Show: Address: 0x...
# Show: TX Hash: 0x...
# Show: Explorer link
```

## üö® **FAILURE RECOVERY PLAN**

### **If Generation Fails**
- **Backup**: Pre-generated contract in `artifacts/backup/`
- **Action**: Use backup file and continue to deploy
- **Message**: "Using pre-tested contract template..."

### **If Deployment Fails**
- **Backup**: Pre-deployed contract address
- **Action**: Show existing deployed contract on explorer
- **Message**: "Here's a previously deployed contract..."

### **If Network Issues**
- **Backup**: Recorded demo video
- **Action**: Play video instead of live demo
- **Message**: "Let me show you a recorded demonstration..."
