# HyperKit AI Agent - Optional Dependencies
# These features are production-ready but not required for core operations

# IPFS RAG Integration (Production-Ready)
# Note: May not be compatible with all Python versions (3.10-3.12)
# If installation fails, IPFS RAG features will be disabled but core system will work
# 
# To install IPFS features:
#   pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
#
# Or manually:
#   pip install ipfshttpclient
#
# IPFS RAG provides:
# - Decentralized vector storage
# - CID-based version tracking  
# - Multi-gateway fallback
# - Pinata integration
#
# Without IPFS:
# - Vector generation still works locally
# - RAG features still functional
# - Only upload/fetch from IPFS is disabled

# Try to install, but don't fail if incompatible
ipfshttpclient>=0.8.0a0  # Using alpha constraint for better compatibility

# Alith SDK - AI Agent Framework for Web3
# Note: Has dependency conflict with dstack-sdk (not on PyPI)
# System works without it - only affects advanced AI agent features
alith>=0.12.0,<1.0

# Alternative: Use local IPFS node
# Install IPFS: https://docs.ipfs.io/install/
# Then use: ipfs daemon

# Pinata API alternative (no package needed)
# Set environment variables:
#   PINATA_API_KEY=your_key
#   PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret

# Optional export formats for batch audit reporting
# PDF export
reportlab>=4.0.0,<5.0

# Excel export
