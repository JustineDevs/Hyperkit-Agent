## File Organization & Production Features

### 🗂️ File Organization Improvements
- **Fixed file organization**: All AI-generated contracts now automatically save to `contracts/agent_generate/` by default
- **Updated CLI defaults**: Changed `--output-dir` default from `./contracts` to `./contracts/agent_generate`
- **Improved documentation**: Updated `GENERATED_FILES.md` to reflect new file structure
- **Moved existing files**: Relocated all previously generated contracts to the correct directory

### 🚀 Production-Ready Smart Contract Generation
- **Generated 5 production contracts**: HyperDAO (ERC20), HyperNFT (ERC721), VotingContract (DAO), DeFi Staking, and more
- **Advanced features**: Role-based access control, vesting schedules, governance integration, security measures
- **Comprehensive auditing**: Automated security analysis with Slither integration
- **RAG-enhanced generation**: DeFi patterns knowledge base for better contract quality

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Updated `core/tools/utils.py`**: Changed default save directory to `./contracts/agent_generate`
- **Enhanced CLI**: Improved file organization and user experience
- **Better error handling**: More robust file saving and validation
- **Documentation updates**: Comprehensive guides for generated file management

### 📁 New File Structure
```
contracts/agent_generate/
├── HyperDAO.sol          - Advanced ERC20 with vesting & governance
├── HyperNFT.sol          - ERC721 NFT with minting & burning
├── VotingContract.sol    - DAO governance with proposal voting
├── defi_staking.sol      - DeFi staking with flexible periods
└── HyperToken.sol        - Basic ERC20 token
```

This update significantly improves the developer experience by organizing all AI-generated contracts in a dedicated directory, making it easier to manage and track generated files.
