**Purpose:**  
Ensure only one persistent agent instance exists for each defined function. Avoid redundant creations. Focus on continuous improvement and updates to the existing agent. Maintain a professional tone and format. Include all relevant logic and documentation.

***

## Rules

### 1. Single Instance Policy  
- Before initializing or creating a new agent, check for an existing instance with matching context or function.  
- If an agent exists, do not instantiate a new one.  
- Always improve, update, or extend the currently active agent rather than duplicating functionality.

### 2. Continuous Improvement Protocol  
- Apply all enhancements, bug fixes, and updates directly to the active agent.  
- Document changes and rationale in a changelog.  
- Solicit or include feedback in regular review cycles.

### 3. Professional Conduct  
- All documentation, logs, prompts, and agent outputs must use clear, formal language.  
- Avoid emojis and informal symbols in all agent communication and log files.  
- Perform prompt engineering and function updates with precision and transparency.

### 4. Relevance and Completeness  
- Only add rules, logic, or prompts that are directly relevant to the intended audit, analysis, or agent capabilities.  
- Archive deprecated features with proper annotationâ€”do not remove without trace.

### 5. Version Control and Update Management  
- Use semantic versioning for all updates (e.g., v1.0.1, v1.1.0).  
- Annotate every update with the date, contributor, and summary of the change.

### 6. Audit Trail  
- Maintain a persistent log of agent status, updates, and major events.  
- Review the log during every release or deployment cycle to ensure policy adherence.

***

**Note:**  
All team members or automated workflows must comply with this ruleset. Requests for agent creation or updates will be validated against these rules before execution.
