## üö¶ Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Requires Immediate Attention)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No external audit yet**: Blocking mainnet use with large funds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Single developer**: Need backup maintainers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No real users yet**: Need community validation

### Medium Risk (Monitored)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency on external RPCs (mitigated: multi-network)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI provider rate limits (mitigated: fallbacks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Constructor argument generation edge cases (documented, being fixed)

### Low Risk
- ‚úÖ Code quality: High, well-tested
- ‚úÖ Documentation: Comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Security practices: Strong
- ‚úÖ Error handling: Fail-loud
