## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in HyperKit, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email (Preferred)**: Send details to [security@hyperionkit.xyz](mailto:security@hyperionkit.xyz)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components (smart contracts, AI generation, modules, etc.)
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, network (Hyperion/Andromeda), and other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
- **Contract Address**: If the vulnerability affects deployed contracts, include contract addresses

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

### Severity Levels

We use the following severity levels:

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Smart contract exploit, fund loss, remote code execution | 24 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, data exposure, contract vulnerability | 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS, AI generation issues | 1 week |
| **Low** | Minor security improvements, UI vulnerabilities | 2 weeks |
