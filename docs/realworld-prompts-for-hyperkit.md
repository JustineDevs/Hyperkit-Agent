## 📋 PROMPT #1: DeFi Staking Protocol (Realistic)

```
hyperagent generate contract --type ERC20 --name StakingToken "
Create a production-ready ERC20 staking contract with:
- 1 billion token supply
- 12% APY staking rewards distributed over 365 days
- Minimum stake: 1000 tokens
- Lock-in period: 7 days (penalty: 10% if withdrawn early)
- Max stake per user: 1M tokens (anti-whale)
- Reward distribution: Monthly snapshots
- Owner functions: pause staking, adjust APY, withdraw rewards
- Security: ReentrancyGuard, SafeMath, checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Use OpenZeppelin ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard
- Compatible with Metis mainnet (chain ID: 1088)
"
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Specific numbers (1B supply, 12% APY, 7-day lock)
- ✅ Real security requirements (ReentrancyGuard, SafeMath)
- ✅ Production considerations (max stake, monthly snapshots)
- ✅ Clear constraints (Metis mainnet)

**What you'll get**:
- Solidity contract with proper state management
- Events for staking/unstaking/claiming
- Safe external calls pattern
- Optimized gas usage

## 📋 PROMPT #3: Gaming Token with Mechanics (Like Your Use Case)

```
hyperagent workflow run "
Create a play-to-earn gaming token 'GAMEX' with:
- Total supply: 500M tokens
- Release schedule: 10% at launch, rest over 3 years (vesting)
- In-game mechanics:
  * Earn 10-100 GAMEX per quest completion
  * Burn 5% of earned tokens (deflationary)
  * Staking gives 2x quest rewards
- Anti-whale measures:
  * Max 2% of supply per transaction
  * Transfer cooldown: 5 minutes between large txs
  * Holder cap: 10M tokens max per wallet
- Governance: DAO voting for game updates
- Treasury: 20% of tokens reserved for liquidity
- Mainnet: Hyperion testnet (chain 133717)
- Interfaces: IGameRewards, ITreasuryManagement
"
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Game-specific mechanics (quest rewards, burning)
- ✅ Real tokenomics (vesting, governance)
- ✅ Anti-whale implementation

## 📋 PROMPT #4: Liquidity Pool / DEX (Advanced)

```
hyperagent workflow run "
Build a Uniswap-style AMM liquidity pool contract 'HyperSwap' with:
- Supported token pairs: USDC/LINK on Metis
- Liquidity provider (LP) tokens minted on deposit
- Constant product formula: x * y = k
- Trading fee: 0.3% (0.2% to LPs, 0.1% to protocol)
- Slippage protection: require output >= minOutput
- Functions:
  * addLiquidity(amountA, amountB, minLiquidityTokens)
  * removeLiquidity(lpTokens, minAmountA, minAmountB)
  * swap(tokenIn, amountIn, minAmountOut)
  * getReserves(), getAmountOut(amountIn)
- Flash swap capability (borrow tokens, repay with fee)
- Events: Swap, Mint, Burn, Sync
- Security: ReentrancyGuard, checks-effects-interactions
- Oracle integration: Track TWAP (time-weighted average price)
"
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Real DeFi mechanics (AMM, slippage)

- Listing functions:
  * listNFT(tokenId, price, duration)
  * unlistNFT(tokenId)
  * buyNFT(tokenId) with ETH/USDC payment
- Bidding system:
  * placeBid(tokenId, bidAmount)
  * acceptBid(tokenId, bidderAddress)
  * rejectBid(tokenId)
- Fees: 2.5% platform fee on sales
- Royalties: Creator gets 5% of every sale
- Events: Listed, Sold, BidPlaced, BidAccepted
- Admin: setFeePercentage, withdrawFees, emergencyPause
- Escrow: Funds held in contract until transfer confirmed
- Safety: NonReentrant, checks-effects-interactions
- Compatibility: Metis (1088) and Hyperion (133717)
"
