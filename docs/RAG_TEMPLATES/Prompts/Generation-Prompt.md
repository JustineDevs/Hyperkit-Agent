## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Context Addition
- Always include security requirements
- Specify OpenZeppelin usage
- Mention gas optimization needs
- Include specific standards compliance
- Add testing requirements

### Feature Specification
- Be specific about required features
- Mention optional features clearly
- Specify access control patterns
- Include upgrade requirements
- Mention integration needs

### Security Focus
- Always request security best practices
- Mention common vulnerability prevention
- Request proper error handling
- Include input validation requirements
- Specify access control patterns

### Code Quality
- Request clean, readable code
- Ask for proper documentation
- Include comprehensive comments
- Request consistent naming
- Ask for modular design

## Example Prompts

### Simple ERC20
```
Create a simple ERC20 token called "MyToken" (MTK) with 1,000,000 initial supply, mintable by owner, using OpenZeppelin contracts and following security best practices.
```

### Complex DeFi
```
Create a decentralized exchange contract with liquidity pools, automated market making, fee collection, and governance integration. Use OpenZeppelin contracts, implement proper security measures, and optimize for gas efficiency.
```

### Governance System
```
Create a token-based governance system with proposal creation, voting mechanisms, timelock execution, and emergency procedures. Use OpenZeppelin Governor contracts and implement comprehensive security measures.
