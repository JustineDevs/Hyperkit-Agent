# Smart Contract Security Audit Checklist

## Pre-Audit Preparation

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code follows Solidity style guide
- [ ] Proper documentation and comments
- [ ] No hardcoded values or magic numbers
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Dependencies
- [ ] All imports are from trusted sources
- [ ] OpenZeppelin contracts used where appropriate
- [ ] No custom implementations of standard functions
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

## Common Vulnerability Checks

### Reentrancy
- [ ] No external calls before state changes
- [ ] ReentrancyGuard used where needed
- [ ] Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed
- [ ] No recursive calls possible

### Access Control
- [ ] Proper ownership patterns
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] No functions with excessive permissions
- [ ] Owner functions properly protected

### Integer Overflow/Underflow
- [ ] SafeMath used for older Solidity versions
- [ ] Built-in overflow protection for 0.8+
- [ ] No unchecked arithmetic operations
- [ ] Proper bounds checking

### Front-running
- [ ] Commit-reveal schemes where needed
- [ ] Random number generation is secure
- [ ] No predictable transaction ordering
- [ ] MEV protection implemented

### Denial of Service
- [ ] No unbounded loops
- [ ] Gas limit considerations
- [ ] No external dependencies that can fail
- [ ] Proper error handling

## DeFi Specific Checks
